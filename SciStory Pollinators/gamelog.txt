Hey what's up - you new to the neighborhood?

Choice: Yeah, just moved here!
Choice: Maybe.

Player chose: Maybe.

Elliot
I dunno where you moved from, but we don't do the whole 'mysterious stranger'
thing here.

Elliot
Anyway, I'm glad you're here, new kid.

Elliot
Great to meet you Megan! I'm Elliot. I'm hoping you'll help me convince Mayor
Watson not to sell our lot to those parking guys.

Elliot
Let me show you some honeybees in action.

Elliot
Cool, right?

Elliot
I think watching how the bees explore the garden can help us find some
evidence to convince the Mayor.

Elliot
Oh, you noticed that theyre flying around? Awesome!

Elliot
What do you think the graph is showing? When it goes up, what does that mean?

Elliot
Why don't you check in with your friends and {a=https://docs.google.com/docume

Not every flower produced a healthy fruit - I wonder why? Was something

Player input: the flowers look weird and sad/n
Elliot
Maybe, but wild plants don't have farmers to care for them, and they still
grow nice fruit! I think the bees might be doing something that changes how
the fruit grow. What do you think?

Player input to ECA: why do the flowers look weird

Elliot
Some flowers can pollinate themselves, but most of them need the help of bees
or other pollinators. A strawberry flower needs pollen from other strawberry
flowers to grow the healthiest fruit. That's hard to do when there aren't many
flowers.

If you're not sure, let's try BeeVR again! Keep an eye on the bees and
flowers, and see if you can figure out what they need.
