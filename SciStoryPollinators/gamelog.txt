Hey what's up - you new to the neighborhood?

Choice: Yeah, just moved here!
Choice: Maybe.

Player chose: Maybe.

Elliot
I dunno where you moved from, but we don't do the whole 'mysterious stranger'

Elliot
Anyway, I'm glad you're here, new kid.

Elliot
Great to meet you Megan! I'm Elliot. I'm hoping you'll help me convince Mayor
Watson not to sell our lot to those parking guys.

Elliot
Let me show you some honeybees in action.

Elliot
Cool, right?

Elliot
I think watching how the bees explore the garden can help us find some
evidence to convince the Mayor.

Elliot
Oh, you noticed that theyre flying around? Awesome!

Elliot
What do you think the graph is showing? When it goes up, what does that mean?

Elliot

Player input to ECA: why do the flowers look weird

Elliot
Some flowers can pollinate themselves, but most of them need the help of bees
or other pollinators. A strawberry flower needs pollen from other strawberry
flowers to grow the healthiest fruit. That's hard to do when there aren't many
flowers.

You're right - pollution can hurt bees by making it harder for them to smell
flowers and find nectar. They can get lost and confused if the air is thick
with smog.

Great to meet you Umesh! I'm Elliot. I'm hoping you'll help me convince Mayor
Watson not to sell our lot to those parking guys.

Elliot
Let me show you some honeybees in action.

Cool, right?

Elliot
I think watching how the bees explore the garden can help us find some
evidence to convince the Mayor.

If you're not sure, let's try BeeVR again! Keep an eye on the bees and
flowers, and see if you can figure out what they need.

Elliot
Why don't you check in with your friends and {a=https://docs.google.com/docume

evidence they've found?{/a}
