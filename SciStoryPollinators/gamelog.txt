That guy over there in the suit is from CityPark. They want to turn our empty

Watson to donate the lot to our food justice project instead.

You step into a bustling room full of scientific equipment. A woman in a lab
coat is currently sorting vials on a nearby counter.

Over by the table, another person is sorting papers and taking notes. You see
brightly colored posters that read 'Community Gardeners'.
