Food justice is this idea that everybody deserves access to healthy food that
they can afford.

Notebook length: 0
Elliot
Food in our community should also include stuff that makes sense for each
person's culture, because not everyone eats the same kinds of foods.

Notebook length: 0
Elliot
So many people in the U.S. only have access to fast-food restaurants, gas
station food, and other places that sell food that is super processed.

Notebook length: 0

There's nothing wrong with eating that food sometimes, but if that's the only
kind of food people in your neighborhood can buy that is affordable, then
everyone has more trouble eating healthy and feeling good.

Notebook length: 0
You see two men in suits sizing up the empty lot. You wonder what so many
