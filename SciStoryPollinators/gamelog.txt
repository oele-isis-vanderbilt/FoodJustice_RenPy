Hey what's up - you new to the neighborhood?

Choice: Yeah, just moved here!
Choice: Maybe.

Player chose: Maybe.

Elliot
I dunno where you moved from, but we don't do the whole 'mysterious stranger'

Elliot
Anyway, I'm glad you're here, new kid.

Elliot
Great to meet you Megan! I'm Elliot. I'm hoping you'll help me convince Mayor
Watson not to sell our lot to those parking guys.

Elliot
Let me show you some honeybees in action.

Elliot
Cool, right?

Elliot
I think watching how the bees explore the garden can help us find some
evidence to convince the Mayor.

Elliot
Oh, you noticed that theyre flying around? Awesome!

Elliot
What do you think the graph is showing? When it goes up, what does that mean?

Elliot

Player input to ECA: why do the flowers look weird

Elliot
Some flowers can pollinate themselves, but most of them need the help of bees
or other pollinators. A strawberry flower needs pollen from other strawberry
flowers to grow the healthiest fruit. That's hard to do when there aren't many
flowers.

You're right - pollution can hurt bees by making it harder for them to smell
flowers and find nectar. They can get lost and confused if the air is thick
with smog.

Great to meet you Umesh! I'm Elliot. I'm hoping you'll help me convince Mayor
Watson not to sell our lot to those parking guys.

Elliot
Let me show you some honeybees in action.

Elliot
Cool, right?

Elliot
I think watching how the bees explore the garden can help us find some
evidence to convince the Mayor.

Elliot
If you're not sure, let's try BeeVR again! Keep an eye on the bees and
flowers, and see if you can figure out what they need.

Elliot
Why don't you check in with your friends and {a=https://docs.google.com/docume
nt/d/1QTPBkV9XNADFgnluxhJ1SjGkWyEDG8Kug7edNoMDLHQ/edit?usp=sharing}see what
evidence they've found?{/a}

Food justice is this idea that everybody deserves access to healthy food that
they can afford.

Notebook length: 0
Elliot
Food in our community should also include stuff that makes sense for each
person's culture, because not everyone eats the same kinds of foods.

Notebook length: 0
Elliot
So many people in the U.S. only have access to fast-food restaurants, gas
station food, and other places that sell food that is super processed.

Elliot
There's nothing wrong with eating that food sometimes, but if that's the only
kind of food people in your neighborhood can buy that is affordable, then
everyone has more trouble eating healthy and feeling good.

Our food justice project needs space to build a community garden in our
neighborhood, so that folks here can grow fresh food that doesn't cost so
much.

Gardens are awesome, obviously, but for some reason the Mayor says he wants to
see data about the benefits before making a decision.

I'm trying to gather some evidence to convince him, but I could really use

Food justice is this idea that everybody deserves access to healthy food that
they can afford.

Notebook length: 0
Elliot
Food in our community should also include stuff that makes sense for each
person's culture, because not everyone eats the same kinds of foods.

Notebook length: 0
Elliot
So many people in the U.S. only have access to fast-food restaurants, gas
station food, and other places that sell food that is super processed.

Notebook length: 0
Elliot
There's nothing wrong with eating that food sometimes, but if that's the only
kind of food people in your neighborhood can buy that is affordable, then
everyone has more trouble eating healthy and feeling good.

The empty lot isn't much - just a wide patch of dirt. Elliot is exploring,
likely imagining what a garden would look like here.

Notebook length: 0
You see two men in suits sizing up the empty lot. You wonder what so many
people are doing wandering around an empty bit of land.

Hello there! I'm Mayor Watson. I'm out here today gathering community opinions
on the empty lot.

Mayor Watson
Do you have any thoughts about it?

Choice: I think you should let the Community Gardeners use the lot for growing
food.
Choice: I think you should let CityPark build a parking [structure] for the
neighborhood.
Choice: I'm not sure.

Ah, interesting. The garden would provide some food for the neighborhood,
though the parking garage might be more financially useful for the city.

I need to consider the research and figure out what is best for our community.
