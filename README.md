# FoodJustice_RenPy

A repo for developing the lightweight, RenPy version of the Food Justice environment.

# Local Setup

## **Local Run Steps**

* Clone https://github.com/oele-isis-vanderbilt/FoodJustice_RenPy.git and work from main, branching for feature work if needed so you don’t ship unstable code to the live server (README.md (line 9)).
* Download the Ren’Py SDK (e.g., renpy-8.3.7-sdk), unzip it, and keep the SDK folder beside FoodJustice_RenPy inside the same parent directory so the launcher can find the project (README.md (line 16)-README.md (line 20)).
* From a terminal, cd into the SDK directory once and run chmod +x renpy.sh so the launcher script is executable; you shouldn’t need to repeat this unless you re-download the SDK (README.md (line 21)-README.md (line 23)).
* To run the GUI build locally, cd into the parent folder that contains both the SDK and the repo, then execute ./renpy.sh SciStoryPollinators/. If you see “permission denied,” rerun chmod +x renpy.sh inside the SDK directory and try again (README.md (line 25)-README.md (line 33)).

## **Web Build Option**

* Double‑click renpy.app inside the SDK folder to open the Ren’Py launcher, select the SciStoryPollinators project in the left pane, then choose Web under Actions (README.md (line 38)-README.md (line 40)).
* Use **Build Web Application** to produce a deployable web.zip/SciStoryPollinators-1.0-dists bundle, or **Build and Run in Browser** to have Ren’Py serve the game locally at a URL like http://127.0.0.1:8042/index.html; refresh the page as you tweak code (README.md (line 42)-README.md (line 48)).
* Approve the prompt to download “RenPy Web” if it appears, and check **Force Recompile** before building when switching branches or if the browser view looks stale (README.md (line 48)-README.md (line 49)).
* The generated SciStoryPollinators-1.0-dists folder inside the repo contains the assets you would upload to a server if you need to host the game online later (README.md (line 54)-README.md (line 55)).

# Narrative Overview

*SciStory: Pollinators* is an interactive, story-driven game where players investigate food access, pollinator ecology, and community decision-making. The adventure unfolds across several neighborhood locations, each filled with characters who share evidence, perspectives, and expertise.

Players collect notes, build arguments, ask free-form questions, and ultimately try to convince the mayor to support a **community garden** instead of a proposed **parking garage**.

This section gives newcomers a simple outline of **the story**, **the spaces**, **key characters**, and **how the endings work**.

## 🌼 Narrative Arc (What Happens in the Story)

### 1. A Dreamlike Beginning

You wake up in a surreal field and meet **Tulip**, a friendly talking honeybee. Tulip orients you, sets up the game world based on your chosen *hometown type*, and introduces the **Notebook**, where you’ll save quotes and evidence during your investigation.

### 2. The Central Conflict

In the neighborhood, **Elliot**, a youth organizer, explains the main problem:

* The community wants the empty lot to become a **garden** for culturally relevant, affordable food.
* The **mayor** wants strong, multi-perspective evidence before rejecting **CityPark’s** proposal for a **parking garage**.

Your job is to gather evidence, speak with residents and experts, and construct an argument that can persuade Mayor Watson.

### 3. Explore the Neighborhood & Collect Evidence

Gameplay loops through several neighborhood locations:

* **Food Lab**
* **Westport Community Garden**
* **The Beehives**
* **The Empty Lot**

At each stop, you talk to characters, collect notes, and can ask **free-form questions** answered by the game’s AI knowledge agent.

### 4. Preparing for the Debate

Back at the empty lot, you debate **Cyrus** from CityPark, revise your arguments with Elliot and Riley, and prepare for the final pitch.

### 5. The Mayor’s Decision

You present your case to **Mayor Watson**, who evaluates your evidence (via an AI scoring agent).He decides whether the lot becomes:

* A **Community Garden**, or
* A **Parking Structure**.

Tulip wraps up the story depending on which outcome you achieve and how well you explored the evidence.

## 👥 Key Characters

| Character | Role & Description |
|----|----|
| **Tulip** | A talkative honeybee who explains mechanics, gives hints, and frames the ending based on the player’s evidence. |
| **Elliot** | Youth organizer who launches the food-justice investigation and helps the player rehearse arguments before the mayoral pitch. |
| **Riley** | Community advocate and persuasive-writing coach who evaluates the player’s arguments and provides food-justice background. |
| **Amara** | Food scientist offering lab-based evidence on nutrients, soil health, and environmental systems. |
| **Wes** | Master gardener who teaches crop science and pollinator ecology, supported by the Pollination Knowledge Agent. |
| **Victor** | Newcomer who shares heirloom-crop stories and highlights the cultural relevance of community-grown food. |
| **Nadia** | Beekeeper who teaches bee ecology and hive health. |
| **Alex** | A kid offering a youth perspective on food access and neighborhood life. |
| **Cora** | Caregiver raising concerns about affordability, time, and safety for families. |
| **Cyrus Murphy** | CityPark marketer promoting the parking-garage proposal and challenging the player’s evidence. |
| **Mayor Watson** | Decision-maker who evaluates the player’s final argument and chooses the game’s ending. |

## 🌳 Endings

### 🌼 Garden Victory

If you persuade the mayor, the lot becomes a **community garden**.Residents, pollinators, and families benefit — and the final scenes celebrate the success of your evidence-based advocacy.

### 🏗️ Parking Structure

If your evidence isn’t strong or complete enough, **CityPark’s parking garage** is approved.Commerce improves, but families lose access to fresh food and pollinator habitats. Tulip reflects on the inequities that remain.



# Tech Stack

## **Game Client**

* Ren’Py drives both SciStoryPollinators (student edition) and SciStoryTeacherDemo, with extensive Python helpers layered into scripts; the logging module records every dialogue line, choice, and upload-ready payload so gameplay analytics stay synchronized with back-end services
* The in-game notebook runs on custom tag normalization/auto-tagging logic that inspects dialogue text, enforces player overrides, and logs edits so saved notes remain queryable for later analysis
* Conversational-agent hooks assemble HTTP payloads that encode the player’s state (visited locations, notes, argument attempts) before calling hosted Food Justice agents, plus response-splitting safeguards for long LLM replies
* Voice features are toggled via Ren’Py screens that proxy to browser JavaScript, enabling Azure TTS playback and mic recording on the web build

## **Realtime + Voice Integrations**

* The exported web build loads custom helpers: azuretts.js streams speech from Azure Cognitive Services, microphoneUtility.js uploads WAV blobs to the ASR endpoint, and syncflow-publisher.js forwards telemetry and screen shares to LiveKit/SyncFlow rooms when enabled

## **Backend Service**

* A FastAPI app logs player events, serves the packaged Ren’Py build, and fan-outs routers for SyncFlow controls and admin auth; logging is persisted through rotating file handlers so live sessions can be audited
* Configuration relies on Pydantic settings models that read .env.app and .env.syncflow, define JWT claims, and expose runtime toggles for camera/mic/screen capture per session
* The /syncflow API authenticates against project credentials (syncflow-python-client) to create LiveKit sessions and mint access tokens, while a lightweight admin login issues signed cookies backed by bcrypt/pyjwt

## **Control Dashboard**

* Observability for facilitators lives in a SvelteKit + Vite single-page app styled with Tailwind/Flowbite; scripts provide dev/build/lint routines and TypeScript tooling for the ControlDashboard bundle served by the FastAPI middleware

## **Dependencies & Tooling**

* Python requirements stay minimal—FastAPI (with Uvicorn extras), bcrypt, PyJWT, and the SyncFlow client—while requirements-dev.txt pins pytest for the harnessed unit suite
* The automated pytest harness stubs Ren’Py/Pygame modules so you can validate labels, notebook logic, logging caps, travel pins, and agent payloads without launching the engine

## **Deployment**

* A multi-stage Dockerfile builds the Ren’Py web bundle, compiles the dashboard, installs service deps, and finally runs uvicorn app.main:app; docker-compose variants point the container at either the student or teacher build and mount log volumes/env secrets
